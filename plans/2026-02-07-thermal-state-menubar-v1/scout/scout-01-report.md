# Scout 01 Report: Codebase Baseline

Date: 2026-02-07

## Inventory
- Repository currently empty except `plans/` created for this planning effort.
- No `codebase-summary.md`, `code-standards.md`, `system-architecture.md`, `project-overview-pdr.md` present.

## Implications
- Plan must bootstrap project architecture from zero.
- Code standards, CI baseline, and release conventions must be defined in early phases.

## Unresolved questions
- Bundle identifier convention (suggested: `com.oscar.macmonitor`).
- Minimum supported macOS version (suggested: macOS 14+).
- Release channel host (suggested: GitHub Releases).
