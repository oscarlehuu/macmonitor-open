# Security Policy

## Supported versions
Security fixes are applied to the latest release on `main`.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| Latest | Yes |
| Older releases | No |

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:
1. Open a private security advisory in GitHub (preferred), or
2. Contact the repository maintainer privately via GitHub.

When reporting, include:
- Affected version/commit
- Reproduction steps
- Impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if available)

We will acknowledge reports as soon as possible and coordinate disclosure after a fix is available.
